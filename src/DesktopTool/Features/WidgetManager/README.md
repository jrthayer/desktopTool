# Widget Manager

A persistent on-screen panel listing the app's three toggleable widgets - Fences, Layout Launcher,
and Snap Lines - each with an on/off switch plus a row-specific action button. It's the entry point
into most of what used to be separate tray items - creating a fence, editing snap lines, and
showing/hiding Layout Launcher all live on its own rows now instead. All of this feature's code
lives under this folder - `WidgetManager/` for the model/store, `WidgetManager/UI/` for the widget
itself. It's built on the same [`LayeredWidgetForm`](../../UI/LayeredWidgetForm.cs) base as a fence
and the [Layout Launcher](../Layouts/README.md#layout-launcher-widget) widget, so it shares their
move/resize/snap/rename/Settings-menu/theming for free - see [UI](../../UI/README.md) for that
shared foundation. Its own entry point - a top-level **Widget Manager** tray item, not nested under
anything - lives in the app-wide [`TrayApplicationContext`](../../TrayApplicationContext.cs) - see
the base [README](../../../../README.md) for the rest of the tray menu.

## Rows

Widget Manager's three rows are fixed - nothing adds or removes one, unlike the Layout Launcher's
own saved-layout list. Each row has a label, an on/off switch (a small hand-drawn pill, since
there's no toggle-switch control elsewhere in the app to reuse), and its own action button:

- **Fences** - the switch shows/hides every fence at once (reads/flips `FenceManager.AnyVisible`,
  the same source of truth the tray's own **Show/Hide All** reads/flips, so the two can never drift
  out of sync with each other or with a fence hidden/shown some other way). **Add Fence** creates a
  new, empty fence.
- **Layout Launcher** - the switch shows/hides that widget (reads/flips its own `Visible`).
  **Edit Layouts** opens **Manage Layouts**, the same as that widget's own button.
- **Snap Lines** - the switch turns every custom snap line (including the seeded default edge
  lines - they're plain entries in the same list, not distinguished from a user-drawn one) off or on
  as a drag candidate app-wide, while fence-to-fence edge snapping keeps working either way - see
  [Fences: Snap lines](../Fences/README.md#snap-lines). **Edit** opens **Manage Snap Lines...** -
  editing lines works regardless of the switch's state.
- **Get Shit Done** - the switch shows/hides the [Get Shit Done](../GetShitDone/README.md) widget
  (reads/flips its own `Visible`). No action button.

## Settings

Beyond the Base flyout every widget on this base shares (see [UI](../../UI/README.md)'s own Style
contract section), Widget Manager's Settings menu has an **Additional** flyout with two more
system-level toggles - **Start with Windows** and **Show Hidden Files** - mirroring the tray menu's
own copies of the same two settings. Both read the actual current state fresh every time the menu
opens (`StartupManager.IsEnabled`/`HiddenFilesManager.IsEnabled`), the same "never shows stale"
convention the tray's own items already use, so toggling one from here or from the tray can never
leave the other showing the wrong state.

## Limitations

Snap Lines had no on/off concept at all before this widget existed - custom lines were always live
snap candidates, only ever suppressed for a single drag by holding the right mouse button. The new
`SnapLineManager.Enabled` flag this row's switch controls is a genuinely new, persisted, app-wide
setting (`snaplines.json`), not just a fresh way to reach something that already existed.
