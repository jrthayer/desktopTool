# Desktop Tool

A Windows desktop app, run from the system tray, built to grow into a
general desktop-organization toolkit over time. Its features are
**Fences**, **Layouts**, and **Widget Manager**, built on a shared
**Snapping** engine — see below.

## Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK
- Windows 10/11

## Build & run

```
dotnet build DesktopTool.sln
dotnet run --project src/DesktopTool/DesktopTool.csproj
```

The app runs as a system tray icon only (no main window). Right-click the
tray icon for the menu.

## Features

### Fences

Draggable, resizable, translucent "fence" regions (Stardock Fences-style)
that group your desktop icons under a name you choose, with drag-and-drop
reordering/moving between fences, a synthetic Recycle Bin item, and
snap-to-fence/snap-to-guide-line dragging.

See [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Fences/README.md`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Fences/README.md)
for the full feature writeup, settings reference, and known limitations.
All of its code lives under [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Fences`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Fences).

### Layouts

Named profiles that relaunch (or reuse, if already running) a set of
programs and place each one's window on a chosen monitor and position.
**Save Current Layout** builds a profile straight from whatever's
currently open and where it's sitting, instead of picking each program by
hand through **Manage Layouts...**. Both live on the **Layout Launcher**
widget, which also lists every saved layout for one-click run. Toggled via
its own row on the [Widget Manager](#widget-manager) widget (tray menu >
Widget Manager).

See [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Layouts/README.md`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Layouts/README.md)
for the full feature writeup, the layout entry model, and known limitations.
All of its code lives under [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Layouts`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Layouts).

**Limitations:** Save Current Layout can end up including one of Desktop
Tool's own windows (a fence) as a captured entry - it's excluded by
matching the window's owning process ID against the running app's own, but
that hasn't reliably kept it out in every case seen so far. Harmless to
leave in a saved layout (running it just tries to "relaunch" Desktop Tool
itself, which is already running and a no-op in practice), but worth
deleting by hand via Manage Layouts if you notice it.

### Widget Manager

A persistent on-screen panel listing the app's three toggleable widgets -
Fences, Layout Launcher, and Snap Lines - each with an on/off switch plus
a row-specific action button (**Add Fence** / **Edit Layouts** / **Edit**),
reachable via the tray menu's own top-level **Widget Manager** item.

See [`src/DesktopTool/Features/WidgetManager/README.md`](src/DesktopTool/Features/WidgetManager/README.md)
for the full feature writeup and known limitations. All of its code lives
under [`src/DesktopTool/Features/WidgetManager`](src/DesktopTool/Features/WidgetManager).

### Get Shit Done

The **Get Shit Done** widget: commit to a few small things for the day, close each one
out as done, partly done, or skipped, and review how the outcomes break down
over time.

See [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Commitments/README.md`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Commitments/README.md)
for how to use it and where its data lives. All of its code lives under
[`src/DesktopTool/Features/Commitments`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Commitments).

### Snapping

The pure edge-snapping geometry (`SnapEngine`) that gives both Fences and
the Layout Launcher widget their drag-to-snap feel — a shared, stateless
utility rather than a user-facing feature of its own.

See [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Snapping/README.md`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Snapping/README.md)
for what it does and how the two features above use it. All of its code
lives under [`src/DesktopTool/Features/Snapping`](src/DesktopTool/Features/Snapping).

## Shared UI foundation

Every draggable on-screen widget (a fence, the Layout Launcher) is built on
the same [`LayeredWidgetForm`](src/DesktopTool/UI/LayeredWidgetForm.cs) base
class - move/resize/snap, rename, a Settings menu, and theming all work the
same way for both rather than each feature reinventing them.

See [`src/DesktopTool/UI/README.md`](src/DesktopTool/UI/README.md) for that
base class and the rest of the shared dark-themed controls it's built from.
All of its code lives under [`src/DesktopTool/UI`](src/DesktopTool/UI).

## Tray menu

- **Widget Manager** — at the top, since it's the entry point into most of
  what used to be separate tray items (see [Widget Manager](#widget-manager)
  above) — creating a fence, editing snap lines, and showing/hiding the
  Layout Launcher all live on its own rows instead now. Toggles the Widget
  Manager widget itself.
- **Show/Hide All** — toggles every fence's visibility at once; also
  triggered by double-clicking the tray icon.
- **Start with Windows** — adds (or removes) Desktop Tool from your user's
  Run key so it launches automatically at sign-in. The checkbox always
  reflects the Run key's actual current state, even if changed by hand.
- **Show Hidden Files** — toggles Windows' own "Show hidden files, folders,
  and drives" Explorer setting (the same one under Folder Options), exposed
  here for convenience since fenced items live in a hidden `hiddenDesktop`
  folder (see [Fences: Desktop icon hiding](src/DesktopTool/Features/Fences/README.md#desktop-icon-hiding)).
  This is a system-wide setting, not something scoped to Desktop Tool -
  turning it on reveals every hidden file on your machine, not just fenced
  ones, and the checkbox always reflects its actual current state even if
  changed from Explorer's own Folder Options instead.
- **Add Recycle Bin** — adds the synthetic Recycle Bin fence item (see
  [Fences: Recycle Bin](src/DesktopTool/Features/Fences/README.md#recycle-bin)) to a
  new, dedicated fence. Hidden once one already exists anywhere, since only
  one is allowed.

**Limitations:** the Show Hidden Files setting itself takes effect
immediately, but the desktop's own icon view doesn't visibly pick it up
until manually refreshed (F5, or right-click > Refresh) - a real Refresh
forces Explorer to re-check which items currently match the filter, which
nothing else tried does. Several alternatives were tried and none worked:
the standard `SHChangeNotify` broadcast Explorer's own Folder Options
dialog sends (refreshes ordinary Explorer windows, not the desktop), the
same plus a forced repaint of the icon list, targeted `SHCNE_UPDATEDIR`
notifications at both real desktop folders, simulating an actual F5
keypress (requires genuine keyboard focus, which proved unreliable to
fake from another process), and posting `WM_COMMAND`/`FCIDM_SHVIEW_REFRESH`
directly (the same message the desktop's own right-click Refresh sends).
The setting is correct immediately either way - only the visual update is
delayed.
